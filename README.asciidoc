Wrapping and packaging for the Xigole JISQL project which provides pure-Java
SQL clients for JDBC data sources. Native binaries not required. Not anymore.
Good fit to accompany J2EE application servers that have JDBC libs anyhow.

Currently this repo provides in a convenient location the JDBC JARs for popular
databases, the JISQL itself, and a shell wrapper script `mysqlj` to probe the
MySQL or compatible database, as was needed in our deployments. Cloning that
script for PgSQL etc. is quite possible, maybe someone will do it some day ;)
